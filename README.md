This Rise 6.9.5 fork is for Android Launchers like PojavLauncher, ZalithLauncher,... which have limitations (GLSL 120, no OpenGL 3.2+,...)

## What changed?

- Added workflow for building when push to **main** branch

- Fixed crash on world load (`NoSuchMethodError`).

- Fixed network IPv4 stack error on Android.

- Fixed GLSL shader compilation failure under gl4es.

## How to install Rise on Android?

1. Download rise-client.jar in github actions tab and Rise.json in releases tab.
2. Create a folder in .minecraft/versions/ (Example: Rise)
3. Move the rise-client.jar and Rise.json into .minecraft/versions/Rise/
4. Make sure renderer is GL4ES and JDK is 21.
5. Enjoy!


## requirements

## modify

full offline, deobf, rename, fix, patch auth, add toggle and more....

## build

```
./gradlew clientJar
```

output: `build/dist/rise-client.jar`

## runnnnnnnnnn
